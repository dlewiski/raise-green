intro:
  heading: Our Mission
  text: >-
    Raise Green is the first crowdfunding platform focused on climate solution
    projects with a social mission.


    We combine the proven investment models of crowdsourcing and project finance to provide innovative pathways for
    non-accredited investors to access sustainable investment opportunities in a
    low-risk, low-cost, and impactful way. We aggregate small investments to
    provide investors with equity into project finance companies. Initially,
    this will take the form of solar projects, as the rate of return is very
    predictable. However, in the future we plan to support the financing of an
    array of climate solution projects.


    Empower communities by funding projects from around the neighborhood and
    around the county. Raise Green offers a tool for individuals to list the
    projects they need in the community, then open the project up for
    investment.


    Everyday people can purchase a part of the company and share in
    the profits or losses associated with the project. Our first projects focus
    on community solar arrays -- the hardest to finance aspect of renewable for
    those who need it most. Communities gain with cheaper utility rates, cleaner
    air, and revenue from the extra electricity their solar panels generate.
