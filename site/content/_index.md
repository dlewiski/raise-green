    work protect people and the planet. We will be listing solar projects for
    low to middle income populations then growing into other projects like
    electric vehicle infrastructure, diesel engine replacements with batteries,
    and microgrids. We are seeking to crowdfund a healthy, just, and sustainable
    society. Who owns the future? We all can if we Raise Green.
